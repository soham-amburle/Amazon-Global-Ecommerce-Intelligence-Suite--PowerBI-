# Amazon – Global E-Commerce Intelligence Suite

## Project Overview
This project simulates an **enterprise-grade Business Intelligence solution** for a global e-commerce leader like Amazon, built using **Power BI** and a large-scale **synthetic retail dataset**.

The objective is to demonstrate how executive leadership, commercial teams, marketing departments, supply chain operations, and finance teams can use data-driven dashboards to monitor **sales performance, customer growth, marketing ROI, inventory efficiency, operational excellence, and profitability**.

The solution is designed as a **9-dashboard executive analytics suite**, similar to real-world BI platforms used in global e-commerce organizations.
